# neighbourhoodMap

This is my project for the frontend module of the Udacity Fullstack Developer course. It is a neighbourhood map using Google Maps, Foursquare and OpenWeatherMap API's and made with Knockout.js.

## What does it do?

If you've ever wanted to know where to go to take in the culture in Cardiff city, this map shows you useful information of the most popular sites. Thirsty afterwards? We can point you to the right place to wet your whistle as well!

## How to run it

You can run the app on your localhost.

If you need help to set up a simple local server look [here](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python)
